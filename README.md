sublime-snippets
================

I love Sublime Text. I'm note a big snippets user but I store them here. Feel free to use them.

## Installing

### With GIT

Navigate to your Sublime Text 3 user packages directory:

`cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/User/`

And clone the repo to a new directory right then and there:

`git clone git@github.com:alienlebarge/sublime-snippets.git`

## Manually

- Download the `.zip` file from the GitHub downloads modal
- Unzip the files and rename the folder to "sublime-snippets"
- Copy the folder to your Sublime Text 2 user packagers directory (`~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User/)

# Bug

If there is a bug or you think the repo need a addition, please [open an issue](https://github.com/alienlebarge/sublime-snippets/issues).
